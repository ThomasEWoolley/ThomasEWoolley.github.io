\section{Squirrels}
\begin{figure}[h!!!tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\tbo]{../../Pictures/red-squirrel-v-squirrel.jpg}
\caption{Squirrels do not like each other.}
\end{figure}
Grey, $G$, and red, $R$, squirrel populations undergo the following interactions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Grey squirrels are born at a rate proportional to their population, where the proportionality constant is $b_1$.
\item Red squirrels are born at a rate proportional to their population, where the proportionality constant is $b_2$.
\item Both squirrel populations compete internally with members of their own population (\ie grey compete with grey and red compete with red, respectively). Namely, whenever two members of the same population interact one of the members is suppressed. The constant of proportionality is $d_1$ for the grey squirrels and $d_2$ for the red squirrels.
\item The squirrels also compete across species. Namely, a grey and a red squirrel interaction can lead to a reduction in red squirrels, or a reduction in grey squirrels. The rate of proportionality for the reduction of grey squirrels is $c_1$, whilst the rate of proportionality for the reduction of red squirrels is $c_2$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write down the interaction equations specified by the above description.

Hint: You should create six equations over all and they should be symmetric in $G$ and $R$ (\ie if you swap $G$ and $R$ the dynamics should be the same).
\item Show that the interaction equations lead to the following ODEs
\begin{align}
\dot{G}&=b_1G-d_1G^2-c_1RG,\\
\dot{R}&=b_2R-d_2R^2-c_2RG.
\end{align}

\item What are the dimensions of $b_1$, $b_2$, $d_1$, $d_2$, $c_1$ and $c_2$ in terms of density and time?
\item Non-dimensionalise the system to produce the following equations
\begin{align}
\frac{\rd u}{\rd \tau}=&u(1-u-\alpha_{12}v),\\
\frac{\rd v}{\rd \tau}=&\rho v(1-v-\alpha_{21}u).
\end{align}
Specify the population scales and the time scales and show that the scales have the appropriate dimensions.
\item What are the parameter groupings $\rho$, $\alpha_{12}$ and $\alpha_{21}$ in terms of $b_1$, $b_2$, $d_1$, $d_2$, $c_1$ and $c_2$? Show that $\rho$, $\alpha_{12}$ and $\alpha_{21}$ are dimensionless.
\item Find all steady states of the system, noting any parameter dependencies that need to be satisfied for the steady state to exist.
\item Calculate the stability of the trivial steady states. Namely, those in which one of the populations is zero, noting parameter dependencies of the stability criterion.

Calculating the stability of the fourth steady state,
\bb
(u_s,v_s)=\frac{1}{1-\alpha_{12}\alpha_{21}}(1-\alpha_{12},1-\alpha_{21}),
\ee
leads to a complicated eigenvalue calculation and we will use curve sketching in the next question to consider the stability of this steady state.

Hint: you should find there are four cases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\alpha_{12}<1$ and $\alpha_{21}<1$; \item $\alpha_{12}<1$ and $\alpha_{21}>1$;
\item $\alpha_{12}>1$ and $\alpha_{21}<1$;
\item $\alpha_{12}>1$ and $\alpha_{21}>1$.
\end{enumerate}
\item Sketch the $(u,v)$ phase plane in each of the cases (a)-(d). You should include: the nullclines; annotations regarding the signs of $\rd u/\rd \tau$ and $\rd v/\rd \tau$ in each region delineated by the nullclines; accompanying directional arrows in each region; directional arrows on the nullclines; and, finally, trajectories illustrating the expected evolution with initial conditions taken from each region.

Use these sketches to determine the stability of $(u_s,v_s)$, when it exists.
\item Describe what happens to the grey and red squirrels in each of the cases (a)-(d).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{align}
G&\mathrel{\mathop{\rightleftarrows}^{b_1}_{c_1}}2G,\quad G+R\stackrel{d_1}{\rightarrow}G.\\
R&\mathrel{\mathop{\rightleftarrows}^{b_2}_{c_2}}2R,\quad G+R\stackrel{d_2}{\rightarrow}R.
\end{align}
\subsubsection{}
Using the Law of Mass Action on the interactions equations shown in answer \ref{Interaction_equations} we get the given equations.
\subsubsection{}
$\textrm{dim}(b_1)=\textrm{dim}(b_2)=1/$time.

\noindent$\textrm{dim}(d_1)=\textrm{dim}(d_2)=\textrm{dim}(c_1)=\textrm{dim}(c_2)=1/$(time$\times$density).

\subsubsection{}
Using $G=[G]u$, $R=[R]v$ and $t= [t]\tau$ we find that $[G]=b_1/d_1$, $[R]=b_2/d_2$, both of which have dimensions of density and $[t]=1/b_1$, which has dimensions of time. 
\subsubsection{}
Subsequently, $\rho=b_2/b_1$, $\alpha_{12}=c_1b_2/(d_2b_1)$ and $\alpha_{21}=c_2/d_1$, which can all be seen to be dimensionless.
\subsubsection{}
The steady states are (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) and
\bb
(u_s,v_s)=\frac{1}{1-\alpha_{12}\alpha_{21}}(1-\alpha_{12},1-\alpha_{21}).
\ee
We note that for $(u_s,v_s)$ to exist then either $\alpha_{12}, \alpha_{21}<1$ or $\alpha_{12}, \alpha_{21}>1$.
\subsubsection{}
The Jacobian of the system is
\bb
J(u,v)=\left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
   1-2u-\alpha_{12} v & -\alpha_{12}u \\
   -\rho\alpha_{21}v & \rho\l 1-2v-\alpha_{21} u\r \\
  \end{array} } \right].
\ee
Thus,
\bb
J(0,0)=\left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
   1 & 0 \\
   0 & \rho \\
  \end{array} } \right].
\ee
The eigenvalues are the diagonal elements, which are both positive. Hence (0,0) is an unstable node.
\bb
J(1,0)=\left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
   -1 & -\alpha_{12} \\
   0 & \rho(1-\alpha_{21}) \\
  \end{array} } \right].
\ee
The eigenvalues are the diagonal elements. Hence, (1,0) is a stable node if $\alpha_{21}>1$ and a saddle point if $\alpha_{21}<1$.
\bb
J(0,1)=\left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
   1-\alpha_{12} & 0 \\
   -\rho\alpha_{21} & -\rho \\
  \end{array} } \right].
\ee
The eigenvalues are the diagonal elements. Hence, (0,1) is a stable node if $\alpha_{12}>1$ and a saddle point if $\alpha_{12}<1$.


In summary (0,0) always exists and is always unstable, (1,0) and (0,1) always exist but their stability depends on $(\alpha_{12},\alpha_{21})$ and, finally, existence and stability of $(u_s,v_s)$ depends on $(\alpha_{12},\alpha_{21})$. Specifically,
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item when $\alpha_{12}<1$ and $\alpha_{21}<1$ (1,0) is unstable, (0,1) is unstable and $(u_s, v_s)$ exists, stability to be considered in the next question.
\item when $\alpha_{12}<1$ and $\alpha_{21}>1$ (1,0) is stable, (0,1) is unstable and $(u_s,v_s)$ does not exist.
\item when $\alpha_{12}>1$ and $\alpha_{21}<1$ (1,0) is unstable, (0,1) is stable and $(u_s,v_s)$ does not exist.
\item when $\alpha_{12}>1$ and $\alpha_{21}>1$ (1,0) is stable, (0,1) is stable and $(u_s, v_s)$ exists, stability to be considered in the next question.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[h!!!tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\tp]{../../Pictures/Competitive_exclusion.png}
\caption{Phase planes in all possible configurations.\label{Phase_plane}}
\end{figure}
From the bottom left sketch of \fig{Phase_plane} we see that when $\alpha_{12},\alpha_{21}>1$ $(u_s,v_s)$ is unstable, specifically, it is a saddle point. Equally, the bottom right sketch of \fig{Phase_plane} shows that when $\alpha_{12},\alpha_{21}<1$ $(u_s,v_s)$ is stable.
\subsubsection{}
In this model we see four possible outcomes. In three of these cases only one of the populations survives and exists at the expense of the other, \ie the red squirrel population survives, but the grey squirrel population dies out. Only in the case that $\alpha_{12},\alpha_{21}<1$ are both populations able to live together. In ecology this concept is called competitive exclusion. It suggests that two species competing for exactly the same resources cannot stably coexist. One of the two competitors will always have an ever so slight advantage over the other that leads to extinction of the second competitor in the long run (or evolution into distinct ecological niches).

\section{Fitzhugh-Nagumo}
In 1952 Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley developed the first quantitative model of the propagation of an electrical signal along a squid giant axon. They received the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work. Fitzhugh and Nagumo simplified this work and showed how the essentials of the excitable process could be distilled into a simpler model, which is analytically tractable.

Let $v$ be membrane voltage potential (note this can go negative) and let $n$ be the cellular recovery variable. The non-dimensional equation controlling voltage spikes in a nerve are given by
\begin{align}
\epsilon \dot{v}&=v(0.5-v)(v-1)-n,\label{v}\\
\dot{n}&=v-\gamma n,\label{n}
\end{align}
where $\gamma$ and $\epsilon$ are positive.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Derive the steady states noting any parameter restrictions.
\item Assume $\gamma<16$, characterise the stability of any steady states that exist.
\item Draw, with as much detail as possible, the $(v,n)$ phase diagrams in the $\gamma<16$ case.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{Answ}
\subsection{Answers}
\subsubsection{}
The steady states are $(0,0)$ and $(v_s,n_s)$, where $n_s=v_s/\gamma$ and
\bb
v_s=\frac{3\gamma\pm\sqrt{\gamma^2-16\gamma}}{4\gamma}.
\ee
The steady states $(v_s,n_s)$ only exist when $\gamma>16$.
\subsubsection{}
The Jacobian is
\bb
J(v,n)=\left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
   \frac{6v-6v^2-1}{2\epsilon} & -\frac{1}{\epsilon} \\
   1 & -\gamma \\
  \end{array} } \right].
\ee
In the case of $\gamma<16$ only $(0,0)$ exist and, so,
\bb
J(0,0)=\left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
   -\frac{1}{2\epsilon}&-\frac{1}{\epsilon} \\
   1 & -\gamma \\
  \end{array} } \right].
\ee
The trace of $J$ is negative, whilst the determinant is positive, therefore, $(0,0)$ is stable.
\subsubsection{}
The $\gamma<16$ phase plane is shown in \fig{Fitzhugh_Nagumo}. Since $1/\gamma$ is the gradient of the $n$ nullcline increasing $\gamma$ corresponds to lowering the $n$ nullcline. Thus, in the case that $\gamma>16$ the line will cut the cubic three times. Further, in this case, the phase plane will suggest that the two extreme steady states are stable, but the middle one is unstable.

\section{Computer simulation}
Simulate \eqns{v}{n} with parameters $\gamma=2$ and $\epsilon=0.001$. Specifically, plot the trajectories in the $(v,n)$ space along with the nullclines. Further, initialise the trajectories near the $(0,0)$ steady state but with negative $v$ initially. Hint: for this simulation you will have to use a `stiff' solver. Matlab's standard solver is \texttt{ode23s}. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item What happens to the trajectories \see{Fitzhugh_Nagumo_sims}?
\item Why is this weird?
\item What happens when you increase $\gamma$?
\item Suppose we have a trajectory that starts at the origin and we increase $\gamma$ past 16 and then lower it again. Could this model exhibit hysteresis?
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}
\begin{Answ}
\subsection{Answers}
\subsubsection{}
Trajectories with a small perturbation head back to zero. If the perturbation sends $v$ negative enough then the trajectory takes a long excursion towards the $v$ nullcline before heading back to (0,0).
\subsubsection{}
Even though (0,0) is stable the trajectory takes a long time to get there. This is called a relaxation trajectory.
\subsubsection{}
The trajectories with initial conditions below the minimum of the cubic head towards the higher steady, rather than head back to (0,0).

\subsubsection{}
This model does not exhibit hysteresis since the lower steady state never disappears, thus, if the trajectory starts there it stays there, regardless the change in $\gamma$.

\section{Damped pendulum}
The equation of a damped pendulum is
\bb
\ddot{\theta}+\underbrace{\eta \dot{\theta}}_{\textrm{Energy loss due to air resistance}}+k\sin(\theta)=0,\label{Damped}
\ee
where $k$ and $\eta$ are positive constants.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write the second order differential \eqn{Damped} as two first order ODEs.
\item Identify the steady states of your two variable system, noting any parameter dependencies.
\item Characterise the stability of the steady states, noting any parameter dependencies.
\item Draw the phase diagram of the system in the $(\theta,\dot{\theta})$ plane. Include nullclines, trajectory directions, stability information of the steady states and draw a number of trajectories to illustrate potential dynamics.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{Answ}
\subsection{Answers}
\subsubsection{}
Let $v=\dot{\theta}$ then
\begin{align}
\dot{\theta}&=v,\\
\dot{v}&=-\eta v-k\sin(\theta).
\end{align}

\subsubsection{}
The steady states are $(0,n\pi)$, where $n$ is an integer.
\subsubsection{}
The Jacobian is
\bb
J(\theta,v)=\left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
   0&1 \\
  -k\cos(\theta) & -\eta \\
  \end{array} } \right].
\ee
Thus,
\bb
J(n\pi,0)=\left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
   0&1 \\
  -k(-1)^n & -\eta \\
  \end{array} } \right].
\ee
The eigenvalues are
\bb
\lambda(n)_\pm=\frac{-\eta\pm\sqrt{\eta^2-4k(-1)^n}}{2}.
\ee
Thus if $n$ is even then $Re(\lambda(n)_\pm)<0$ and the steady state is stable. Note that it is either a node or a spiral depending on how large the damping, $\eta$, is. Namely, large damping makes the point a stable node, whilst small damping will provide a stable spiral. This coincides with our physical intuition, namely, if there is little damping the pendulum will continue to oscillate.

Alternatively, if $n$ is odd $\lambda_-<0<\lambda_+$, thus, we have a saddle.

\section{Similar systems}
Consider the two following systems:
\begin{align}
\dot{u}_1&=u_2,\\
\dot{u}_2&=-u_1,
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
\dot{v}_1&=v_1v_2,\\
\dot{v}_2&=-v_1^2.\label{v2}
\end{align}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that the quantities of $u_1^2+u_2^2$ and $v_1^2+v_2^2$ are conserved across their respective systems. What does this mean?
\item Illustrate the differences between the two systems by calculating the steady states, characterising their stability and drawing the phase planes with as much information as possible.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{Answ}
\subsection{Answers}
\subsubsection{}
There are two ways to show that the squared sum of each set of variables is constant. Firstly, we could differentiate the sum with respect to time and substitute in the ODEs, \ie
\bb
\frac{\rd}{\rd t}(u_1^2+u_2^2)=2u_1\dot{u}_1+2u_2\dot{u}_2=2u_1u_2-2u_2u_1=0.
\ee
Since the derivative is zero, the integral must be a constant with respect to time.

Alternatively, we can divide one equation by the other and integrate the resulting equation,
\bb
\frac{\dot{v}_1}{\dot{v}_2}=\frac{\rd v_1}{\rd v_2}=-\frac{v_2}{v_1}.
\ee
Separating the derivative we find that
\bb
\int^{v_1}_0 v'_1\rd v'_1=-\int^{v_2}_0 v'_2\rd v'_2,
\ee
namely $v^2_1+v^2_2=$constant.

This means that however $u_1$ and $u_2$, or $v_1$ and $v_2$ evolve, they must always satisfy the equation of a circle, which will be determined by the initial conditions. Thus,  the trajectories of $(u_1,u_2)$ and $(v_1,v_2)$  prescribe circles.

\subsubsection{}
In each case (0,0) is a steady state. In the second case $(0,v)$ is also a steady state for all values of $v$. The Jacobian for each case is
\bb
J(u_1,u_2)=\left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
   0&1 \\
  -1 & 0 \\
  \end{array} } \right],
\ee
and
\bb
J(v_1,v_2)=\left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
  v_2&v_1 \\
  -2v_1 & 0 \\
  \end{array} } \right].
\ee
In the first case the eigenvalues of (0,0) are $\pm I$, thus, it is a centre. In the second case $J$ the eigenvalues of $(0,v)$ are 0 and $v$. Thus, if $v>0$ the state is unstable and if $v\leq0$ the stability cannot be determined through linearisation as 0 is an eigenvalue. However, we know that $(v_1,v_2)$ must always lie on a circle and from \eqn{v2} we can see that $v_2$ is always decreasing. The minimum value it can obtain is at the bottom of the circle $v_1^2+v_2^2=$constant$=v_1(0)^2+v_2(0)^2$ (where we are specifying that the constant depends on the initial condition), \ie when $v_1=0$, which causes the system to stop evolving. Thus, all trajectories will evolve to $(0,v_2)$, where $v_2=-\sqrt{v_1(0)^2+v_2(0)^2}$.

%\section{Lotka-Volterra equations}\label{Lotka-Volterra equations}
%Data on the number of Canadian lynx and snowshoe hair pelts traded where collected by the  Hudson Bay trading company\footnote{Caution about the data: I have not been able to verify this data, but this is the data (or rather the graph) that is always cited. This particular set of data came from scanning in the graph from Odum's "Fundamentals of Ecology", p. 191 which is often cited. Odum says that his graph is taken from MacLulich's "Fluctuations in the numbers of varying hare", 1937, which is not widely available. Some authors caution that this data is actually a composition of several time series, and should probably not be analyzed as a whole, and that some of the lynx data was actually missing. It is said that the data was collected from Hudson's Bay historical records, and does not reflect animal populations, but rather the number of pelts turned in for trading (a large number of which came from Native Americans- mentioned because there were some medical outbreaks during these years which could account for skewed data). The data are presented here with these cautions. }. The data are presented in \fig{Lynx_hare} and has been used as a proxy for population data.

%\end{figure}
%In this questions we consider a mathematical model that has been suggested to describe the features seen in the data. Specifically, it is a predator-prey interaction model called the Lotka-Volterra model. The model is based on a number of assumptions, such as:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item the prey population finds ample food at all times.
%\item the food supply of the predator population depends entirely on the size of the prey population.
%\item if the populations are separated then the prey population rate of increase is proportional to its size and the predator population rate of decrease is also proportional to its size.
%\item during the process, the environment does not change in favour of one species and genetic adaptation is inconsequential.
%\item predators have limitless appetite.
%\end{itemize}
%Let $L$ be the lynx population and $H$ be the hare population. The interaction equations are 
%\bb
%\underbrace{H\stackrel{k_1}{\rightarrow}2H}_{\textrm{Hares reproduce.}}, \quad \underbrace{H+L\stackrel{k_2}{\rightarrow}2L}_{\textrm{Lynx prey upon the hares.}}, \quad \underbrace{L\stackrel{k_3}{\rightarrow}\slashed{0}}_{\textrm{Lynx die out.}}.

%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Describe two features seen in the population data of \fig{Lynx_hare}.
%\item Write down the ODEs representing the interaction system.
%\item Let $u$ and $v$ be non-dimensional of the hare and lynx, respectively. Non-dimensionalise the system to produce a system of the form:
%\begin{align}
%\dot{u}&=u-uv,\label{LV1}\\
%\dot{v}&=\alpha(uv-v)\label{LV2},
%\end{align}
%where the time derivative is with respect to some non-dimensionalised time.
%
%Provide the dimensional scales of the population (i.e. $[L]$, $[H]$ and $[t]$) as well as the definition of $\alpha$. Note, that you are not required to show that $[L]$ and $[H]$ have the right dimension and $\alpha$ is dimensionless, but it is a good way to check your working.

%\section{Bifurcations}
%Consider the following set of equations which model the interactions of two populations $N_1$ and $N_2$:

%\dot{N}_1&=r_1N_1\l 1-\frac{N_1}{K_1+b_{12}N_2}\r,\\
%\dot{N}_2&=r_2N_2\l 1-\frac{N_2}{K_1+b_{21}N_1}\r.
%\end{align}
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item What dynamics are occurring between the species $N_1$ and $N_2$?
%
%Hint 1: by the symmetry of $N_1$ and $N_2$ in the equations whatever $N_1$ is doing to $N_2$, $N_2$ is doing to $N_1$. This means that the dynamics could be mutual creation (mutualism) or mutual destruction (competition).
%
%Hint 2: Compare the above equations to regular logistic curve $\dot{u}=ru(1-u/K)$. What happens if we increase or decrease $K$? Thus, what influence does increasing or decreasing $N_1$ have on $N_2$?
%
%\item Use $N_1=K_1u_1$, $N_2=K_2u_2$, $\tau=r_1t$ to non-dimensionalise the equations. You should find that you can rewrite the parameters of the system as $\rho=r_2/r_1$, $\alpha_{12}=b_{12}k_2/k_1$ and $\alpha_{21}=b_{21}k_1/k_2$.
%

%What restrictions (if any) do we need to place of the steady states?
%\item Determine the linear stability of the steady states. Taking care to note any bifurcation conditions and how they relate to the restrictions on the steady state existence.
%\end{enumerate}
%\subsection{Answers}
%\subsubsection{}
%An increase in $N_1$ causes and increase in the steady state of $N_2$, thus, we have mutualism. Namely the population both cause each other to grow.
%\subsubsection{}
%The equations simplify to:
%\begin{align}
%\dot{u}_1&=u_1\l 1-\frac{u_1}{1+\alpha_{12}u_2}\r,\\
%\dot{u}_2&=\rho u_2\l 1-\frac{u_2}{1+\alpha_{21}u_1}\r.
%\end{align}
%\subsubsection{}
%Setting $\dot{u}_1=\dot{u}_2=0$ provides the given steady states. Note that we need $\alpha_{12}\alpha_{21}>1$ for $(\bar{u}_1,\bar{u}_2)$ to make sense as a positive steady state, since we are dealing with populations.

%The Jacobian is

%\bb
%J(0,0)=\left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
%   1 & 0 \\
%   0 & \rho \\
%  \end{array} } \right],
%\ee
%meaning that $(0,0)$ is an unstable node.
%\bb
%J(0,1)=\left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
%   1 & 0 \\
%   a\rho & -\rho \\
%  \end{array} } \right],
%\ee
%meaning that $(0,1)$ is a saddle.
%\bb
%J(1,0)=\left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
%   -1 & a \\
%   0 & \rho \\
%  \end{array} } \right],
%\ee
%meaning that $(1,0)$ is a saddle.
%\bb
%J(\bar{u}_1,\bar{u}_2)=\left[ {\begin{array}{cc}

%Calculating the eigenvalues, $\lambda$, of $J(\bar{u}_1,\bar{u}_2)$ we find that
%\bb
%\lambda^2 +\underbrace{(1+\rho)}_{>0}\lambda+\underbrace{\rho(1-\alpha_{12}\alpha_{21})}_{>0}=0.
%\ee
%Since the coefficient of $\lambda$ and the constant term are positive (equally the trace and determinant of $J(\hat{u}_1,\hat{u}_2)$ are negative and positive, respectively), then $(\bar{u}_1,\bar{u}_2)$ is stable whenever it exists.

%\section{Predator competition}
%One of the assumptions in the Lotka-Volterra equation is that the predation effect is proportional to both the predator and prey population. However, as the number of prey increases the  competition between predators will increase, thus, we consider the adapted equations
%\begin{align}
%\dot{u}=u-uv,\\
%\dot{v}=b(uv-v)-bv^2.
%\end{align}
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item What are the steady states of the system?
%\item Characterise the stability of the valid steady states, noting any dependences on the parameter $b$.
%\item How does predator competition change the outcome of the situation, compared to the basic Lotka-Volterra equation shown in question \ref{Lotka-Volterra equations}?
%\end{enumerate}
%\subsection{Answer}
%\subsubsection{}
%The steady states are $(0,0)$, $(0,-1)$ and $(2,1)$.
%\subsubsection{}
%The Jacobian is
%\bb
%J(u,v)=\left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
%   1-v & -u \\
%   bv & b(u-1-2v) \\
%  \end{array} } \right],
%\ee
%so, 
%\bb
%J(0,0)=\left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
%   1 & 0 \\
%   0 & -b \\
%  \end{array} } \right],
%\ee
%meaning that (0,0) is a saddle point.
%\bb
%J(2,1)=\left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
%   0 & -2 \\
%   b & -b \\
%  \end{array} } \right].
%\ee
%The eigenvalues satisfy
%\bb
%\lambda^2+b\lambda+2b=0,\quad\implies\lambda_\pm=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b(b-8)}}{2}.
%\ee
%For $0\leq b < 8$ $\lambda_\pm$ is complex and the real part is negative, so we have a stable spiral. For $b\geq 8$ $\lambda_-<\lambda_+<0$ and so we have a stable node.
%\subsubsection{}
%In the basic Lotka-Volterra case, all trajectories are closed, periodic orbits. In the case of predator competition the non-zero steady state is always stable.
%\section{The Lorenz equations}
%In 1963, Edward Lorenz developed a simplified mathematical model for atmospheric convection. The model is a system of three ordinary differential equations now known as the Lorenz equations:
%\begin{align}
%\dot{x}&=\sigma (y-x),\\
%\dot{y}&=x(\rho -z)-y,\\
%\dot{z}&=xy-\beta z.
%\end{align}
%The equations relate the properties of a two-dimensional fluid layer uniformly warmed from below and cooled from above. In particular, the equations describe the rate of change of three quantities with respect to time: $x$ is proportional to the rate of convection; $y$ to the horizontal temperature variation; $z$ to the vertical temperature variation. The constants $\sigma$, $\rho$, and $\beta$ are system parameters proportional to the Prandtl number, Rayleigh number, and certain physical dimensions of the layer itself.
%
%For simplicity, let $\sigma=\beta=1$.
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item What are the steady states, noting dependencies of $\rho$?
%\item Characterise the stability of the  zero steady state only, noting dependencies of $\rho$. Note that you will have to find the eigenvalues of a $3\times 3$ matrix. Substituting in the values of the steady state will help you. The non-zero steady states are always either stable nodes or stable spirals when they exist.
%\item Simulations for $\rho>1$ and $\rho<1$ are illustrated in \fig{Lorenz_stable}. Do these accord with your findings?
%\end{enumerate}
%
%EXTENSION 1: If you are brave enough calculate the eigenvalues corresponding to the non-zero steady states and show that they always have negative real part when $r>1$, but they may be complex.
%
%EXTENSION 2: If you are even braver rerun the analysis with variables $\sigma=10$, $\rho=28$ and $\beta=3$. This causes the system to act chaotically. Categorise the steady states in this case. What happens? An image of the chaotic trajectory can be seen in \fig{Lorenz_chaotic}.

%There are three steady states:

%(0,0,0), \quad(\pm\sqrt{\rho-1},\pm\sqrt{\rho-1},\rho-1).

%thus, the eigenvalues satisfy the equation
%\bb
%(-1-\lambda)((-1-\lambda)^2-\rho)=0,\quad \implies\lambda_{-1}=-1,\quad\lambda_{\pm}=-1\pm\sqrt{\rho}.
%\ee
%Hence, $(0,0,0)$ is stable if $0<\rho<1$ and unstable if $\rho>1$.
%\subsubsection{}
%The simulations in \fig{Lorenz_stable} show that when $0<\rho<1$ the steady state always tends to the origin. However, for $\rho>1$, the trajectory tends to one of the non-zero steady states depending on the initial condition.
%
%
%
%\subsubsection{EXTENSION 1}
%The stability of the $(\pm\sqrt{\rho-1},\pm\sqrt{\rho-1},\rho-1)$ states are both the same. Here, we will illustrate how to extract the eigenvalues of $(\sqrt{\rho-1},\sqrt{\rho-1},\rho-1)$, the negative case is similar.
%\bb
%J(\sqrt{\rho-1},\sqrt{\rho-1},\rho-1)=\left[ {\begin{array}{ccc}
%   -1 & 1 & 0 \\
%   1 & -1 & -\sqrt{\rho-1} \\
%   \sqrt{\rho-1}  & \sqrt{\rho-1} & -1 \\
%  \end{array} } \right],
%\ee
%thus, the eigenvalues satisfy the equation
%\begin{align}
%0&=(-1-\lambda)((-1-\lambda)^2+(\rho-1))-((-1-\lambda)+(\rho-1)),\\
%&=\lambda^3+3\lambda^2+(1+\rho)\lambda+2(\rho-1),\\
%&=(\lambda+2)(\lambda^2+\lambda+\rho-1).\\
%\end{align}
%Hence,
%\bb
%\lambda_{-2}=-2,\quad\lambda_{\pm}=\frac{-1\pm\sqrt{5-4\rho}}{2},
%\ee
%and all eigenvalues have negative real part whenever $\rho>1$.
%
%\subsubsection{EXTENSION 2}
%In the case that  $\sigma=10$, $\rho=28$ and $\beta=3$ the eigenvalues relating to $(0,0,0)$ are
%\bb
%\lambda_1\approx-22.8,\quad\lambda_2\approx 11.8\quad\lambda_3=-3.
%\ee
%So the state is unstable. The non-zero steady states are $(\pm9,\pm9,27)$, the accompanying eigenvalues are
%\bb
%\lambda_1\approx-14.1,\quad\lambda_2\approx 0.04+10.7I\quad\lambda_3=0.04-10.7I.
%\ee
%Thus, these states are also unstable. Normally, when all steady steady states are unstable we would expect the trajectory to tend to infinity along one of the coordinates, creating a singularity. However, the trajectories in these simulations are always bounded, thus, they can't escape to infinity. Equally, they can not oscillate around one of the critical point because otherwise it would be a centre and not unstable. Thus, something more complicated must be occuring. Namely, chaos!a

%%Enzymes are biological molecules (typically proteins) that significantly speed up the rate of virtually all of the chemical reactions that take place within cells. They are vital for life and serve a wide range of important functions in the body, such as aiding in digestion and metabolism.

%%
%%In 1913 Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten proposed a mathematical model of how enzymes work. The process involves an enzyme, $E$, binding to a substrate, $S$, to form a complex, $C$, which in turn releases a product, $P$, regenerating the original enzyme. This may be represented schematically as
%%\bb
%%E+S\mathrel{\mathop{\rightleftarrows}^{k_1}_{k_{-1}}}C\stackrel{k_2}{\rightarrow}E+P.

%%S(0) = S_0,\quad E(0) = E_0,\quad C(0) = 0,\quad P(0) = 0.
%%\ee
%%\item Show $E+C=$constant$=E_0$.
%%\item Why can we ignore the equations for $\dot{P}$ and $\dot{E}$? Specifically, show that we only need to consider the equations
%%\begin{align}
%%\dot{S}&=-k_1(E_0-C)S + k_{-1}C,\\
%%\dot{C}&=k_1(E_0-C)S -( k_{-1}+k_2)C.
%%\end{align}
%%\item Use the following scales to non-dimensionalise the equations
%%\bb
%%t=\frac{\tau}{k_1E_0}\quad S=u S_0\quad C=v E_0,
%%\ee
%%to produce the following system
%%\begin{align}

%%What are $\epsilon$, $\lambda$ and $K$? Show that $\epsilon$, $\lambda$ and $K$ are non-dimensional.
%%\item What are the initial conditions?
%%\item \label{Inner}Suppose $E_0\ll S_0$ (what does this mean?) and substitute the time scale $\sigma=\tau/\epsilon$ into \eqns{u}{v}. You should be able to show that the solution of the system is
%%\begin{align}
%%u(\sigma)&=1,\nonumber\\
%%v(\sigma)&= \frac{1}{1+K}\l 1-\exp(-(1+K)\sigma)\r.
%%\end{align}
%%Hint: $E_0\ll S_0\implies \epsilon\ll 1$, thus, once the equations have been multiplied take the limit of $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$ in the $\rd u/ \rd \sigma$ equation. Solve this and substitute the solution for $u$ in the $\rd v/ \rd \sigma$ equation.
%%
%%\item Return to \eqns{u}{v} and let $\epsilon\rightarrow0$. Show that we can write $v$ as a function of $u$, which simplifies the $\rd u/\rd \tau$ equation to
%%\bb
%%\frac{\rd u}{\rd \tau}=-u+(u+K-\lambda)\frac{u}{(u+K)}, \quad u(0)=1.
%%\ee \label{Outer}
%%\end{enumerate}
%%In questions \ref{Inner}-\ref{Outer} you have done a multiple scales simplification of the Michaelis-Menton problem. Namely, the whole equation is hard to solve. However, we can solve for what the equation looks like for small time, $\sigma$ (question \ref{Inner}) and we can solve for what the equations looks like for large time, question (\ref{Outer}). In the computation question, which is next, we check these approximations.

%%You can find more about the spruce budworm population equation and an online applet that allows you to simulate the system quickly and easily at the following website:
%%\bb
%%http://mathinsight.org/spruce\_budworm\_outbreak\_model
%%\ee
%%
%%The above website may aid in the following questions as we are going to consider the steady states of
%%\bb
%%\frac{\rd u}{\rd \tau}=ru\l 1-\frac{u}{k}\r-\frac{u^2}{1+u^2}=f(u).\label{Spruce}
%%\ee
%%We could solve $f(u)=0$, however, this leads to a cubic in $u$. This can be solved, but it is not very fun. Instead, we are going to consider sketches of the system. 
%%
%%We could sketch $f(u)$, directly, and draw arrows on the diagram, such that $u$ is increasing if $f(u)>0$ and $u$ is decreasing if $f(u)<0$. This will immediately tell us how many stationary states there are and inform us of their stability. We will do this towards the end of this question, however, going straight into the full sketch may cause us to miss certain cases, as we have two parameters, $r$ and $K$, to worry about. However, if you feel confident shoot straight to question \ref{sketch_f}.
%%
%%Critically, the following questions only deal with sketches. Thus, you do not have to be exactly accurate in your plotted values. We are just need to provide the general shape of the curve. This means little, if any, calculation should be required. Namely, an exact analytical result is not required, only approximate sketches backed up by logical thought.
%%
%%\begin{enumerate}
%%\item By inspection $u_0=0$ is always a steady state of $f(u)$ (make sure you understand why). Instead of considering $f(u)$ let us consider the two functions
%%\bb
%%f_1(u)=r\l 1-\frac{u}{k}\r,\quad f_2(u)=\frac{u}{1+u^2}.
%%\ee
%%Sketch $f_2$ on three different axes. Fix the value of $r/k$ to be greater than zero (say $r/k=0.05$), but allow $r$ to vary (with $k$ being defined by, say, $k=0.05/r$). Sketch on these three different plots $f_1$ for different values of $r$, namely consider $r$ small, medium and large\footnote{Note that small, medium and large values are ill-defined. Specifically, when saying such terms you should always specify compared to what. Namely, small, or large, compared to what value? Thus, if you are plotting these accurately consider $r\in [0.4,0.6]$.}
%%
%%
%%
%%\item Draw on your above diagrams regions where $f_1>f_2$ and regions where $f_2>f_1$.
%%
%%\item Noting that a steady state, $u'$, satisfies
%%\bb
%%f(u')=0=u'(f_1(u')-f_2(u')),
%%\ee
%%use your sketches of $f_1$ and $f_2$ to plot three situations of $f(u)$\label{sketch_f}.
%%
%%\item You should be able to show that (depending on the value of the parameters) there can be as few as two steady states and as many as 4 steady states. Name the four steady states $0=u_0<u_-<u_s<u_+$, in the obvious way. Specify on your diagrams these four steady states.  The middling value of $r$ sketch is given in \fig{r_medium}.

%%
%%\item Use each sketch of $f(u)$ to state the stability of each steady state, $u_0$, $u_-$, $u_s$ and $u_+$ (when they exist).
%%
%%
%%\item Does the system exhibit hysteresis? To solve this follow these steps:
%%\begin{enumerate}
%%\item start with a low value of $r$, such that only $u_0$ and $u_-$  exist. Suppose to start with a small initial condition, where do you evolve to?
%%\item increase $r$ until $u_0$, $u_-$, $u_s$, $u_+$ all exist, what happens to the point you evolve to?\label{1}
%%\item increase $r$ further until only $u_0$ $u_+$ exist, what happens to the point you evolve to?
%%\item decrease $r$ until $u_0$, $u_-$, $u_s$, $u_+$ all exist, what happens to the point you evolve to?\label{2}
%%\item is the point you evolve to in step \ref{1} the same as the point you evolve to in step \ref{2}? Use this to answer the original question.

%%\subsubsection{}
%%\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
%%\item when $r$ is small only $u_0$ and $u_-$ exist and, so, the system will tend to $u_-$.
%%\item as $r$ increase $u_s$ and $u_+$ will appear, but $u_-$ is still stable and so the system stays where it is, as $u_-$.
%%\item for large $r$ $u_-$ disappears. The system then evolves to $u_+$.
%%\item reducing $r$ to the previous value brings back $u_-$, but $u_+$ still exists and is stable so the system stays at $u_+$.
%%\item originally we were at $u_-$ now we are at $u_+$, even though we have reduced $r$ back to the previous position. Since these are different steady states the model presents hysteresis.

%%\section{Stability of a one variable system}
%%Consider the following equation
%%\bb
%%\dot{u}=u(1-u)^3(u-2)^2(3-u)(4-u).\label{Stability_test}
%%\ee
%%\begin{enumerate}
%%\item What are the steady states?
%%\item Linearise around each steady state. Which steady states are stable and which are unstable? Why can you not categorise the stability of $u=1$ and $u=2$?
%%\item Sketch the phase plane $(u,\dot{u})$ and show that your linear analysis tallies with the stability information gained from the sketch.
%%\item Use the sketch to categorise the stability of $u=1$ and $u=2$.
%%\end{enumerate}
%%\subsection{Answer}
%%\subsubsection{}
%%Steady states are $u_s=0,1,2,3,4$.
%%\subsubsection{}
%%For linear stability analysis we need to check the sign of $\rd f(u_s)/\rd u$.
%%\bb
%%\frac{\rd f}{\rd u}=-2(u-1)^2(u-2)(4u^4-33u^3+88u^2-80u+12).
%%\ee
%%and, so,
%%\begin{align}
%%\frac{\rd f}{\rd u}(0)&=48>0\nonumber\\
%%\frac{\rd f}{\rd u}(1)&=0\nonumber\\
%%\frac{\rd f}{\rd u}(2)&=0\nonumber\\
%%\frac{\rd f}{\rd u}(3)&=24>0\nonumber\\
%%\frac{\rd f}{\rd u}(4)&=-432<0\nonumber.
%%\end{align}
%%Thus, $u_s=0,3$ are unstable, $u_s=4$ is stable and we can not categorise $u_s=1,2$ because the equation has at least a double root at these points and, as such, the derivative evaluates to zero.
%%\subsubsection{}
%%\fig{Revision_stability_one_variable} illustrates that $u_s=0,2,3$ are unstable, whilst $u_s=1,4$ are stable.
