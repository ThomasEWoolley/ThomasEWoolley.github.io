class="ec-lmr-8">Caution about the data: I have not been able to verify this data, but this is the data (or rather the graph) that is always cited. This particular set</span>
  <span 
class="ec-lmr-8">of data came from scanning in the graph from Odum&#8217;s "Fundamentals of Ecology", p. 191 which is often cited. Odum says that his graph is taken from</span>
  <span 
class="ec-lmr-8">MacLulich&#8217;s "Fluctuations in the numbers of varying hare", 1937, which is not widely available. Some authors caution that this data is actually a</span>
  <span 
class="ec-lmr-8">composition of several time series, and should probably not be analysed as a whole, and that some of the lynx data was actually</span>
  <span 
class="ec-lmr-8">missing. It is said that the data was collected from Hudson&#8217;s Bay historical records, and does not reflect animal populations, but</span>
  <span 
class="ec-lmr-8">rather the number of pelts turned in for trading (a large number of which came from Native Americans- mentioned because there were</span>
  <span 
class="ec-lmr-8">some medical outbreaks during these years which could account for skewed data). The data are presented here with these cautions.</span>
